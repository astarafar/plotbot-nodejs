PlotBot is something I'm working on for one of the FFXIV housing Discord servers, because housing in FFXIV is an unmitigated disaster.

## Okay, what?

Yeah, that could bear some explaining. Okay, here we go.

In Final Fantasy XIV, an MMORPG by Square Enix (and one of my favorite games), players can, if they are 1. sufficiently drowning in gil and 2. lucky beyond all comprehension buy a house, an actual house, in an actual neighborhood. These are, as you can imagine, in some demand.

Well, buying a house suuuuucks. A plot of land becomes available, but it can't be purchased for some amount of time between ??? minutes and ??? hours, sometimes exceeding a full DAY. If you run up and try to buy it, you can't. Instead of buying a house, you acquire sadness for free. All you can do is camp the plot and keep trying. Over, and over, and over, often for hours.

This bot is intended to at least help with the planning and situational awareness regarding what plots are available and how long they've been up (statistically speaking, most plots sell beyond the ten-hour mark, so that's when people consider it "prime time," thus the time tracking portion) as reported by users.

## You're really doing this, huh?

Yup. AWESOME, AIN'T IT?
